                        <p>New York is the largest and one of the most diverse cities in the United States, consisting of around 8.55 million residents. Because there is such an overwhelming number of people residing in New York City, there is a large number
                            of crimes that take place there. In 2017, there was a total of around 95,000 crimes committed in New York City across the major felony categories. Additionally, in New York City there are around 500,000 people who own guns.
                            With the goal of keeping New York City residents safe from gun violence as well as with the hopes of reducing rates of all criminal acts in the city, a practice called Stop, Question, and Frisk was established in 2002 by Mayor
                            Michael Bloomberg’s administration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The stop, question and frisk program is a practice established by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that involves temporarily detaining, questioning, and searching civilians they deem a threat on the street for weapons and other contraband. Although
                            many individuals claimed their neighborhoods felt safer after the implementation of stop-and-frisk, studies have proven that this practice did not correlate to a decrease in crimes. Rather, the broader problem with stop-and-frisk
                            was that there were many accusations made toward the NYPD of targeting individuals of color and other minorities. According to our dataset, more than half of those detained and searched were black, and nearly a third were Latino.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found that the breakdown of the demographic of stop and frisk was as follows: 54% Black, 29% Latino, 11% White, 9% other. The overall population of New York City was 45% White, 25% Black, 27% Latino, 3% other. There is a huge discrepancy, especially
                            in Black residents of New York City, in the percentage of a given race in the city and the frequency that that race got stopped by officers. While only about a quarter of the population is Black, they represent over half of
                            all people who are frisked. Below is a relevant article to show the further effects of the Stop and Frisk Policy in New York City.

                        <h5 class="question">What is your dataset?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">For this project, we chose two datasets to analyze. The first dataset chosen is the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page">Stop, Question and Frisk Dataset</a>. This dataset was found in the
                            New York Police Department (NYPD) section of The Official Website of the City of New York under ‘statistics’. The stop, question and frisk program is a practice established by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that
                            involves temporarily detaining, questioning, and searching civilians they deem a threat on the street for weapons and other contraband. The second dataset chosen is titled <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Statistics-By-Zip-Code/kku6-nxdu">Demographic Statistics by Zip Code</a>.
                            This dataset was found on NYC Open Data.

                        <br>
                        <h5 class="question">Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">The implementation of the stop, question and frisk procedure by the Police Department in New York has always been incredibly controversial. There are some that claim this procedure has made many neighborhoods in NYC much safer,
                            however there are others that accuse the NYPD of targeting individuals of color and other minorities. This controversy is something that has always been of interest to us, so we wanted to take the analysis a step further and
                            see how effective the practice really is in catching criminals. By comparing the stop, question and frisk dataset with the dataset of demographic Statistics by Zip Codes, we will be able to get a better look at if an individual’s
                            race plays a role in the NYPD’s enforcement of stop, question and frisk.

                        <h5 class="question">What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">The end goal is for the user to easily see whether or not race is a factor in a police officer’s decision to stop, question and frisk a person in each postal code in New York City. Our visualizations allow the user to click on
                            any district in New York City to see both a scatter plot of stop and frisk encounters classified by race and two donut graphs. One graph shows the area’s breakdown of demographic of the overall population while the other shows
                            the area’s breakdown of demographic of stop and frisk encounters. These visualizations will make it easier to see if there is a large difference between who lives in New York and who is getting stopped in New York.

                        <h5 class="question">Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing:</h5>
                        <p class="answer">There were many of aspects of the stop and frisk data set that we did not need or needed to change. Data like whether the suspect was cuffed, their height and whether they were verbally aggressive was not needed, and those columns
                            were removed. The data set gave us the position of the frisking using NYC’s data geocoding system. This corresponds to state plane coordinates which we could not use in visualizations. In order to use these numbers we had to
                            pass the numbers through a function we made that translated the coordinates into longitudes and latitudes which we could then project onto a map in d3. We also had to reformat some of the dataset to remove white space and drop
                            duplicate data.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5 class="question">Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.</h5>
                        <p class="answer">Our dataset started 7.2 MB with 22561 rows. After cleaning and preprocessing we cut it to 1.6 MB with 21075 rows. We found that the breakdown of the demographic of stop and frisk was as follows: 54% Black, 29% Latino, 11% White,
                            9% other. The overall population of New York City was 45% White, 25% Black, 27% Latino, 3% other. There is a huge discrepancy, especially in Black residents of New York City, in the percentage of a given race in the city and
