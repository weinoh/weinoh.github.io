                        <p>New York is the largest and one of the most diverse cities in the United States, consisting of around 8.55 million residents. With such a large population comes crime, and in 2017, there was a total of around 95,000 major felonies committed in New York City.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The high level of crime, combined with a population of 500,000 gun-owners, encouraged then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration to establish a practice called Stop, Question, and Frisk in 2002.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                        <p>
                            The program is a practice ran by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that involves temporarily detaining, questioning, and searching civilians they may deem a threat for weapons and other contraband. Although
                            many individuals claimed their neighborhoods felt safer, studies have proven that this practice did not correlate to a decrease in crimes. The policy's efficacy and ethics have been <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/stop-and-frisk-racist-and-ineffective"> questioned, </a> and
                            there have been many accusations that the NYPD has targeted minorities. According to our dataset, more than half of those detained and searched were black, and nearly a third were hispanic.

                        <h5 class="question">What is your dataset?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">For this project, we chose two datasets to analyze. The first dataset chosen is the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page">2015 Stop, Question and Frisk Dataset</a>. This dataset was found
                            in the New York Police Department (NYPD) section of The Official Website of the City of New York under ‘statistics’. The stop, question and frisk program is a practice established by the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
                            that involves temporarily detaining, questioning, and searching civilians they deem a threat on the street for weapons and other contraband. The second dataset chosen is titled <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Statistics-By-Zip-Code/kku6-nxdu">Demographic Statistics by Zip Code</a>.
                            This dataset was found on NYC Open Data.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5 class="question">Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">The implementation of the stop, question and frisk procedure by the Police Department in New York has always been incredibly controversial. There are some that claim this procedure has made many neighborhoods in NYC much safer,
                            however there are others that accuse the NYPD of targeting individuals of color and other minorities. This controversy is something that has always been of interest to us, so we wanted to take the analysis a step further and
                            see how effective the practice really is in catching criminals. By comparing the stop, question and frisk dataset with the dataset of demographic Statistics by Zip Codes, we will be able to get a better look at if an individual’s
                            race plays a role in the NYPD’s enforcement of stop, question and frisk.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5 class="question">What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">The end goal is for the user to easily see whether or not race is a factor in a police officer’s decision to stop, question and frisk a person in each postal code in New York City. Our visualizations allow the user to click on
                            any district in New York City to see both a scatter plot of stop and frisk encounters classified by race and two donut graphs. One graph shows the area’s breakdown of demographic of the overall population while the other shows
                            the area’s breakdown of demographic of stop and frisk encounters. These visualizations will make it easier to see if there is a large difference between who lives in New York and who is getting stopped in New York.

                        <h5 class="question">Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing:</h5>
                        <p class="answer">There were many of aspects of the stop and frisk data set that we did not need or needed to change. Data like whether the suspect was cuffed, their height and whether they were verbally aggressive was not needed, and those columns
                            were removed. The data set gave us the position of the frisking using NYC’s data geocoding system. This corresponds to state plane coordinates which we could not use in visualizations. In order to use these numbers we had to
                            pass the numbers through a function we made that translated the coordinates into longitudes and latitudes which we could then project onto a map in d3. We also had to reformat some of the dataset to remove white space and drop
                            duplicate data.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="question">Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.</h5>
                        <p class="answer">Our dataset started 7.2 MB with 22561 rows. After cleaning and preprocessing we cut it to 1.6 MB with 21075 rows. We found that the breakdown of the demographic of stop and frisk was as follows: 54% Black, 29% Latino, 11% White,
                            9% other. The overall population of New York City was 45% White, 25% Black, 27% Latino, 3% other. There is a huge discrepancy, especially in Black residents of New York City, in the percentage of a given race in the city and
                            the frequency that that race got stopped by officers. While only about a quarter of the population is Black, they represent over half of all people who are frisked.

                        <br>
                        <h5 class="question">What genre did you choose for this visualization?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">We are using a partitioned poster for this visualization. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, we do not believe that it is necessary to look at our data in a certain order. The initial map shows an overarching view of the five boroughs of New York City. It is possible to then click on a certain race and see that population throughout the five boroughs. The viewer can look at whichever one interests them first, and then look to the other to give their opinions more context. This is perfect for a partitioned poster genre, and we believe it helps tell the story most completely.

                        <h5 class="question">Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">From the 3 categories of Visual Narrative, the tools we found useful were close ups, feature distinction, and zooming. All three of these tools were from the highlighting category. With the use of these features, the user can have a much better understanding of how to navigate through the information on the visualization. These features also keep the data clean and organized by only covering one piece of information at a time, which will make the user more inclined to dig deeper into the data.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="question">Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">For Narrative Structure, the tools we utilized in our visualization were hover highlighting / details, selection, navigation buttons, explicit instruction, captions / headlines and accompanying article. The tools that came from the interactivity category were hover highlighting / details, selection, navigation buttons and explicit instruction. When creating a successful visualization, it is very important to make sure the user can get involved in learning about the information provided and to make sure the story of the data is told in an enticing and easy-to-interpret way. These tools were useful because it allowed the user to have a hands-on experience in learning about the data set while also making it easy for the user to navigate through the visualization. The tools that came from the messaging category were captions / headlines and and accompanying article. These tools were utilized in order to benefit the user because it guides the user through the material and makes it easier to figure out where certain information can be found.

                        <h5 class="question">Explain the visualizations you’ve chosen. </h5>
                        <p class="answer">The first visualization we have chosen is a scatter geoplot of stop and frisk encounters classified by race. It shows each race, as well as the location of the stop and frisk. We decided to take this route because we thought that
                          it would be interesting to see if there was a link between certain geographic areas, and which races were targeted in these stops. Our second visualization is a brush timeline of a stacked bar chart. This was important because it was a simple way to
                          show a lot of information. First, by having a timeline histogram, we can see by looking at the overall numbers which time of day was most common for the stop and frisk policy to be enacted. Secondly, by having a stacked bar chart, we could see how time of day
                          affected the racial bias/breakdown of the policy. Finally, by implementing a brush, we are able to take a look at the geographical points of a stop at a certain time of day, and possibly make connections. We also decided to animate this brush, so that the viewer
                          could see how a typical day in NYC looks from the perspective of the Stop and Frisk policy.

                        <h5 class="question">Why are they right for the story you want to tell?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">We think that they are right for this story because they show a complete picture of who is targeted in these stops, and where they are targeted, as well as what time of day. We believe that they allow the reader to take in a lot of information,
                          without overloading them, and allow them to create their own opinions on the subject. The visualizations is broad enough to show for many different interests on the subject, and yet can be very specific.

                        <h5 class="question">What went well?</h5>
                        <p class="answer">Creating the visualization was an interesting experience. Building each piece resulted in new insight on the policy, and it was exciting to decide where the visualization should go. Each piece created a discussion for which direction we wanted to go,
                          and talking this through within our group was a fun experience due to different ideas on the issue. We believe that this visualization shows a lot of information while still being simple enough that anyone can draw an opinion from it. This combination of complexity and
                          simplicity is something that makes us proud.

                        <p class="answer">We would have liked to make a clear connection to how these percentages compared to the population of NYC, but our data had empty fields for zip codes. Although the data processing went well, the missing data would have been incredibly helpful
                           in further simplifying and specifying our data. Because there were no zip codes listed in the stop and frisk data set, it was necessary to do reverse geocoding to get the zip codes. However, by the time that we were able to do this, it left little time to make
                           the changes for some of our original ideas. We also would have liked to include information about these stops depending on their race, such as whether force was used. We thought of creating a bubble chart to show this information, but again had little time to add this.

                        <p class="answer">Our group did a really good job at making sure everyone was involved in all aspects of the project. We wanted to make sure each of us had a solid understanding of every component of the project, however we split up main responsibilities for each section. Emily was responsible for finding the datasets and doing background research on the information within the data to get a better understanding of how we can analyze it. She was also responsible for the motivation and genre sections of the report. Kyle was responsible for getting the data ready for the visualizations. He cleaned it up and manipulated it so it only reflected the data needed for the project. He also completed the basic stats and discussion section of the report.  Adam was responsible for creating the visualization to its entirety and making sure it utilized all of the necessary tools to make it as effective as possible for users. He was also responsible for the visualization and discussion sections of the report.
